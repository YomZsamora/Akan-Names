# GitSearch-Quotes

GitSearch-Quotes is simply an Angular App that uses Github API to retrieve user data. Submit a username and it gives you repository details of the user, including number of repositories, commits and branches and also when it was last updated. It also has a quotes platform where you can add your favorite quotes in it. It includes a button to delete a quote that you don't find appropriate. You can also upvote or devote a quote based on your personal opinion about it. A quote with most likes will be highlighted. It will also give you the time since the quote has been created.
